# Software Engineer Interview Assessment

Thanks for taking the time to interview at CivilGrid, we appreciate it! The following assessment is meant to test your technical, UI/UX, product thinking, and decision making skills.

## Prompt

You have been hired by the City of Los Angeles to build a web application to find project synergies between the city's various departments. One such opportunity is increasing capacity at existing EV chargers within the city as they are undertaking other capital improvements.

In the `data` folder, there are two datasets in GeoJSON format:

`cip_projects.json`: Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) in the City of Los Angeles
`ev_chargers.json`: Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers in the City of Los Angeles

Your task is to build a tool that enables the city manager to view the areas where CIP projects are scheduled to take place and highlight EV chargers within that area.

## Rules

- The application should be built using React and TypeScript. Feel free to use any other libraries or frameworks
- The end product should be deployed and accessible at a public facing link (eg. [Render](https://render.com), [Netlify](https://netlify.com))
- We ask that you time-box it to 3 hours of focused effort. We use the time constraint to understand how you prioritize and communicate trade-offs. It’s okay if it’s not a finished product!

## Next steps

- Push the code to a private GitHub repo and invite [Sharath](https://github.com/sharathprabhal) and [Brandon](https://github.com/brandonfcohen1)
- Setup time [here](https://calendly.com/sharathprabhal/45m) to walk us through the project. Please give us atleast 24 hours to review the code before the walkthrough
